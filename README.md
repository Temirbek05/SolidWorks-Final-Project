This project focuses on designing a fully engineered quadcopter drone using SolidWorks. 
The goal was to create a lightweight, stable, and structurally efficient frame suitable for educational, prototyping, or experimental use. 
The design includes four motor arms arranged in an “X” configuration, a central body for electronics, and reinforced motor mounts to maintain rigidity during flight.
